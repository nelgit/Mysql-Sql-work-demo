# Command Line: shell>, or cmd

shell> mysqldump -u user -p db_name --ignore-table=db_name.Excluded_tbl(...) --no-create-info > /path/backup_db.sql

# This uses the shell>, or cmd, command line to invoke mysqldump.  
# It Takes the contents of database db_name and 
# creates as backup file backup_db with its copied contents
# while also excluding any table specified by --ignore-table=.
# --no-create-info : this prevents mysqldump from including DROP TABLE and CREATE TABLE statements in its output 
# which will wipe your table when importing.
# (...) is not actual mysql command, but a substitute for multiple ignore tables commands 
# such as  --ignore-table=db_name.Excluded_tbl, --ignore-table=db_name.Excluded_tbl1, --ignore-table=db_name.Excluded_tbl2,
# --where="additional clauses" can be inserted within the logic to further specify what needs to be retrieved.
