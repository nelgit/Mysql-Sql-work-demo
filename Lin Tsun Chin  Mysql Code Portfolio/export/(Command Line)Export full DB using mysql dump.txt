# Command Line: shell>,cmd

shell> mysqldump -u username -p db_name --no-create-info > /path/backup_db.sql  

# This uses the shell>, or cmd, command line to invoke mysqldump.  
# It Takes the contents of database db_name and 
# creates as backup file backup_db with its copied contents. 
# --no-create-info : this prevents mysqldump from including DROP TABLE and CREATE TABLE statements in its output 
# which will wipe your table when importing.
