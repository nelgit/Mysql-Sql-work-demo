# Command Line: shell>, or cmd

shell> mysqldump -u username -p db_name table_name(...) --no-create-info > /path/backup_db.sql  

# This uses the shell>, or cmd, command line to invoke mysqldump.  
# It Takes the contents of database db_name and table table_name and
# creates as backup file backup_db with its copied contents.  
# --no-create-info : this prevents mysqldump from including DROP TABLE and CREATE TABLE statements in its output 
# which will wipe your table when importing.
# (...) is not actual mysql commands, but a substitue for multiple table names, tb1, tbl2, tb2 etc.
# --where="additional clauses" can be inserted within the logic to further specify what needs to be retrieved.
