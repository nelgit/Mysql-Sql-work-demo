For use transfering data.
Stripping the header would be used with when used with INTO OUTFILE to create a pure data file to import into something like excel or another table. 

Example: 

	mysql -u user -p testdb -sNe"
	select * INTO OUTFILE exported_table_data FIELDS TERMINATED BY ',' OPTIONALLY ENCLOSED BY '"' LINES TERMINATED BY '\n'
	FROM selected_table"

-N option:

	invoke mysql with the -N (the alias for -N is --skip-column-names) option:

	mysql -N ...
	use testdb;
	select * from names;

	+------+-------+
	|    1 | pete  |
	|    2 | john  |
	|    3 | mike  |
	+------+-------+

-s option:

	To remove the grid (the vertical and horizontal lines) around the results use -s (--silent). Columns are separated with a TAB character.

	mysql -s ...
	use testdb;
	select * from names;

	id  name
	1   pete	
	2   john
	3   mike
	
	
You can also fake it like this:

	select column1 as '', column2 as '' from some_table;
