# Command Line: shell>, or cmd

#To import a tab seperated file
shell> mysql -u root -p -e " USE dbname; LOAD DATA LOCAL INFILE '/path/Import_File' INTO TABLE your_table LINES TERMINATED BY '\n'"


#To import a comma seperated file
shell> mysql -u root -p -e " USE dbname; LOAD DATA LOCAL INFILE '/path/Import_File' INTO TABLE your_table FIELDS TERMINATED BY ',' LINES TERMINATED BY '\n'"


# This uses the shell>, or cmd, command line to import into mysql database dbname, into the table specified your_table. 
# The contents of a file Import_File is imported thru the use of the mysql command LOAD DATA INFILE.
# LOCAL specifies that the the file to be import in on the client machine and not the host machine.
# REPLACE and IGNORE keywords control handling of input rows that duplicate existing rows on unique key values:
# If you specify REPLACE, input rows replace existing rows. 
# If you specify IGNORE, rows that duplicate an existing row on a unique key value are discarded. 
# * If you do not specify either option, the behavior depends on whether the LOCAL keyword is specified. 
# Without LOCAL, an error occurs when a duplicate key value is found, and the rest of the text file is ignored. 
# With LOCAL, the default behavior is the same as if IGNORE is specified.
