Inner Join: matches rows in one table with rows in other tables and allows you to query rows that contain columns from both tables.

	Example: Joining tables, actor and actor_info, to find the common actors included in each table.
			
			Select actor.last_name, actor.first_name
			From  actor
			Inner JOIN actor_info ON actor.last_name = actor_info.last_name AND actor.first_name = actor_info.first_name
			Limit 0, 10;
