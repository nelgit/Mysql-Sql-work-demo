Union: allows you to combine two or more result sets from multiple tables into a single result set.   
	
* UNIONs (UNION and UNION ALL) require that all the queries being UNION'd have:
  The same number of columns in the SELECT clause
  The column data type has to match at each position


	Example: Select citys from table city, combine them with countries from table country, rename them as "city + country mixed"
			 use order by desc to have cities start listing from Z and countries start listing from A to show merger.
	
				(
					select city "city + country mixed"
					from city 
					order by city desc 
					limit 10
				)
				UNION 
				(
					select country "city + country mixed"
					from country 
					order by country asc 
					limit 10
				)  
				limit 20;	
					 
					Result
